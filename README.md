## Summary
This is a Unity repo exploring the combination of 2d drawing tablets with 3d displays. The intention of the project is to find out what works well using a 2d drawing surface to create in 3d space.

### Hardware Requirements
Output: A Looking Glass Portrait.
Input: A drawing tablet of some kind.

### How To
- Open this project in Unity editor version 2022.3.34f1 or newer.
- Navigate to scenes
- Drag and drop the "UI and Painting" scene into the scene builder window.
- Build and Run for Windows.

### Controls
Use the tip of the drawing tablet to control the cursor. The tip controls both drawing and translating the drawn object. The barrel buttons when pressed open a pop up menu. There are four orbs, the top two are only functional. White is the drawing mode, while red is the translate mode. In translate mode, use the pen tip to drag the most recent drawn object around the scene relative to the camera.
